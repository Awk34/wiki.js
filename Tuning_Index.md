Tuning
======

*The Tuning section is to set operating parameters and adjustments in Speeduino using the TunerStudio interface for correct and best operation. Tuning is application specific and to a particular use. Some references to the Configuration section will be necessary.*

The major tables that require tuning are:

-   -   [VE Table](tuning "wikilink")
    -   [Spark Table](Spark_Table "wikilink")
    -   [AFR Table](AFR_Table "wikilink")
