Non-360 Decoder
---------------

This is a variation of the dual-wheel decoder that can be used with tooth counts that do not divide evenly into 360Â° This decoder system is usually unique to a particular brand or engine series, and therefore has previously been assigned a name to identify the type, such as the Audi 135 decoder. While this "uneven divisor" decoder can be used with a variety of tooth counts, not all tooth counts can be used with this system.
