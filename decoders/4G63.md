## 4G63 Patter
The 4g63 trigger is used across a large number of both Mitsubishi and Mazda 4 cylinder engines. See below for applications.

It is comprised of crank and cam signals that are provided by either a hall sensor or an optical sensor. The signal is electrically the same in both cases.

### Applications

- Mitsubishi Lancer
- NA Miata / MX-5 (Up to 1997)

### Tuner Studio Configuration

### Timing adjustment

In most cases altering the trigger angle should not be required, however there is some small variation between the OEM versions of thIs trigger so some minor adjustment may be needed. Once you have the engine started, set a fixed ignition angle and check the timing with a timing light. If this is a few degrees out (&lt;20°), adjust the trigger angle here. If this is more than 20° out, there may be a larger problem.
