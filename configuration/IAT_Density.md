Overview
--------

The IAT density curve represents the change in oxygen density of the inlet charge as temperature rises. 

## Curve
![iatDensity.png](/img/constants/iatDensity.png){.align-center width=400}

This default curve approximately follows the ideal gas law and is suitable for most installations, however if you are seeing very high inlet temperatures (Either due to heat soak in the engine bay or from turbocharging) the you may need to adjust the hot end of this curve.
