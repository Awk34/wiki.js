<p>The UA4C uses SMD technology to make a 4 ignition/4 injection channel board smaller, with more features, and cheaper. It is a bottom mounted Arduino MEGA shield. The MEGA is placed upside down on top of it.* This makes the total package thickness less than 20mm. All of the outputs (except for stepper idle) include an LED for quick troubleshooting during setup. An externally accessible jumper blocks resetting of the system when a USB cable is connected. Wire housings and 50 (four extra) terminals are included to connect your wiring to the PCB. Will fit in the slim or standard height Hammond case. If you include soldering service the sensors, connectors, etc will be soldered to the board. If you require special provisions you can leave a note on your order use the contact form on the help page.</p>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<p>– 4 ignition channels, logic 5V, 330mA max pulse<br>– 4 injector channels, ground switching<br>– 4 high current outputs (idle, idle2, boost, vvt) ground switching<br>– 8 low current outputs (fuel pump, tachometer, fan, fan2, aux1-4) ground switching<br>– Accepts DRV8825 module for stepper idle control</p>
<h4>Inputs</h4>
<p>– 2 triggers (crank, cam, etc, logic level with socket for conditioner modules)<br>– MAP (250 or 400kPa) and separate barometer<br>– Voltage correction<br>– Throttle position<br>– Coolant and incoming air temperature<br>– Oxygen<br>– Flex fuel<br>– Launch<br>– Knock (future code update)<br>– 2 spare inputs</p>
<h4>Communications</h4>
<p>– Serial3 routed to external connector (optional CAN with future module)<br>– Bluetooth header with blocking diode to allow use of USB</p>
