<p>The No Overhang Two Channel boards made for Speeduino share the features below</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Arduino MEGA 2560 shield board</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Same size as the Arduino</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 2 injector output channels</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 2 coil output channels</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Dedicated tachometer output</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 4 medium/high current outputs (idle, boost, VVT, fuel pump, fan, etc)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; IAT, CLT, TPS, and O2 inputs (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; On-board MAP sensor</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Stepper idle control through board mounted DRV8825 accessory PCB</p>
<p>- &nbsp; VR conditioning through board mounted VR conditioner accessory PCB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the official Speeduino boards, the NO2C requires igniter driven coils and a conditioner for crank/cam signals that aren't 5v square-wave. The board is designed to accept the official Speeduino conditioner board for signals that do not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO2C v0.1.x</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uses the AMP MTA-100 or Molex KK100/KK254 connector system and through hole components</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### v0.1.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Had flaws which caused the Arduino USB connector to interfere with the boards solder pads</p>
<p>- &nbsp; lacked tachometer output</p>
<p>- &nbsp; was never released</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### v0.1.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; corrected the issue mentioned above</p>
<p>- &nbsp; added tachometer output</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO2C v0.2.x</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uses the Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connector system and through hole components. The Micro-Fit connector is used as a computer power connector and there are several manufacturers, it's known generically as 3mm connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some tips that will help make the assembly of your board a success: **[v0.2.x Assembly Tips](v0.2.x_Assembly_Tips "wikilink")**</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### v0.2.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Added pass through pinholes around the edge for daughter board expansion</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Increased size of resistor footprints making it easier to find usable resistors and/or use precision resistors for all voltage dividers</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Increased pitch of 1uf caps (see above)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Added launch control input</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### v0.2.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Improved silk screen</p>
<p>- &nbsp; All MOSFET outputs (injector and auxiliary) have the same gate connection to the Arduino MEGA</p>
<p>- &nbsp; VR signals are routed straight into the conditioner</p>
<p>- &nbsp; MAP sensor location accepts either though-hole or SMD part</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Other routing and placement adjustments (R10 and R11 are flipped)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### v0.2.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Moved C20 from the edge of the board, it has always bothered me there</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Added Serial0/Bluetooth header</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Other routing and placement adjustments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### vC1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Traditional reset protection removed in favor of a jumper and resistor to hold the reset pin high</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Routing and placement adjustments</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Version style changed to bring inline with other projects and due to required BOM change compared to v0.2.x</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO2C DB</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A daughter board that stacks on top of the NO2C v0.2.x and vCx boards to add the features below. The daughter boards are hybrid surface mount/through hole, see features below for which parts are through hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### DB1 (Scraped)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes it easy to add additional general outputs, and can be populated to add all the features below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 4 low current outputs (through hole)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 2 general digital inputs (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 1 analog input (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Flex-fuel input (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Barometric pressure sensor (provides constant correction vs power on base)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### DB2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes it easy to add additional coil outputs, and can be populated to add all the features below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 2 additional coil output channels (through hole)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 4 low current outputs</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 2 general digital inputs (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; 1 analog input (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Flex-fuel input (protected)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; Barometric pressure sensor (provides constant correction vs power on base)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the low current outputs you could reconfigure two of the medium/high current outputs on the NO2C to act as injector drivers. To do this you will have to make minor changes to the firmware before programming the Arduino.</p>
